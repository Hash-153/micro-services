# ADR-184: Cryptographic Digital Signing for Commercial Invoices and Receipts

## Status
**ACCEPTED** (Date: 2026-08-29)

## Context & Problem Statement
Operating an enterprise-scale distributed commerce platform requires formalizing architectural standards across domain boundaries to guarantee operational stability, security, and developer velocity.

## Decision
We formally adopt **Cryptographic Digital Signing for Commercial Invoices and Receipts**.
Embed digital cryptographic SHA-256 signatures in generated commercial invoice PDFs for legal non-repudiation.

### Key Principles:
1. **Zero Data Loss**: Every financial transaction and inventory allocation is guaranteed by ACID transactions and distributed saga compensation.
2. **Deterministic Behavior**: State transitions follow validated mathematical state machines and cryptographic invariant checks.
3. **Observability**: Distributed traces, structured JSON telemetry, and Prometheus metrics provide real-time operational visibility.

## Consequences & Trade-offs
### Positive:
- High horizontal scalability, zero data loss, and predictable system performance.
- Full compliance with enterprise security, PCI-DSS Level 1, and SOX frameworks.

### Negative:
- Continuous review and adherence required in code reviews and CI/CD pipelines.
